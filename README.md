# PythonFinalProject
Machine learning script developed for final project in a python class

There will need to be multiple imports and downloads before running the script. Namely:
- Anaconda
- Tensorflow
- PIL
- matplotlib
- numpy

description:
This script is designed to train from a database of 28x28 pixel hand-drawn numbers 0-9 and be able to guess any given 28x28 number input into the script 0-9. Uses keras from tensorflow and has 3 layers. The script will run the training, then ask the user to input an image to guess. Then, it will guess what the number is an end.
